     Happy birthday my lovee💝
You always make my world brighter even when I’m low. Your smile, laughter brings me so much joy. These days, I’ve seen you improve on telling me how you feel and not just keep it to yourself. I’m really proud of you for that. In those silent battles, know that I’m always there for you. Even if I may not know that you’re having a silent battle. Today, you’re 17. Woah!! Thats crazy. We used to lie that we were 17 or 18.. now.. we’re turning into it..(me next year…) it doesn’t feel real.. how I wish I could physically give you these letters. But I know someday in our future I can.I love receiving and writing letters and I’m so happy you also feel the same. Im grateful Aly taught me how to code some of these for you.. I wanted to make it myself but I needed help… so Aly coded all of these for me to give to you. I’ll never forget the words you said during valentines day… trust me… I’m preparing…. mentally and physically **COUGH** anyways! I hope you have a wonderful birthday day today outside💝 Even if you might not graduate with honors, you still did your best. You actually studied, did a lottt of hardwork. Plus, the best memories ever this school year! You mean the world to me, (you are my world.) I love you so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much. (That was totally not 17 “so”..
